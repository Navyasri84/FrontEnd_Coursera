    <!-- Element Selectors
    The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their 
    element type. -->
    <p>Once upon a time...</p>
    <p>In a hidden land...</p>

    <!-- ID Selectors
    The ID selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element. Since the id is unique 
    within a webpage, it allows the developer to select a specific element for styling. 
    ID selectors are prefixed with a # character. -->
    <p id="latest">New!</p>

    <!-- Class Selectors
    Elements can also be selected based on the class attribute applied to them. 
    The CSS rule has been applied to all elements with the specified class name. 
    The class selector is prefixed with a . character. -->
    <a class="navigation">Go Back</a>
    <p class="navigation">Go Forward</p>

    <!-- Element with Class Selector
    A more specific method for selecting HTML elements is by first selecting the HTML 
    element,then selecting the CSS class or ID. -->
    <p class="introduction">Hello...</a>

    <!-- Child Selectors
    Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select 
    elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent). -->
